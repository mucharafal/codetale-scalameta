To be honest I'm kind of leaning towards sqlite with a single table\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table index(\r\nkey bytes primary key,\r\nvalue bytes,\r\nbinaryVersion string\r\n)\r\n```\r\nwhere we can upgrade binary version when we change the indexing algorithms and want clean up old indices.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be a big change from what we have now using plain jdbc, and we could avoid the locking issues.",
