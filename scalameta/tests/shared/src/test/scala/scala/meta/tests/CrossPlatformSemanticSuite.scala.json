Even though it reads oddly, since the if is so close to the naming I tend to name it in the case that the off is correct, which makes readability of the code after the => better.\r\nHow about \r\n```\r\nCase semanticDbPath if v.SemanticdbPaths.isSemanticdb(semanticDbPath.name) =>\r\n```\r\nAt the point of checking in isSemanticdb(...) it is really candidatePath, it may or may not be true, but if the check succeeds this is definitely a semanticDbPath, not just any path so I prefer to at least carry that information along in the name since it is not in the type.",
